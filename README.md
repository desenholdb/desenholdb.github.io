►About
I'm a brazilian technical artist with over a decade of experience in 3D graphics and game development. My passion for the digital world began in childhood and it was fueled by my curiosity about how things work and the emotions they evoke. Crafting meaningful experiences that leave a lasting impact brings me joy, and the journey of making friends and learning along the way reassures me that I'm exactly where I belong.
