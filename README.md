►About
Technical Artist with a background in game development, 3D art, programming, and video production. With a Bachelor’s degree in Digital Design, my understanding of both artistic and technical workflows, allowing me to bridge the gap between artists and developers.

I have led teams, developed production tools, and contributed to a variety of projects, from mobile games to VR experiences, educational and promotional applications. Passionate about problem-solving and innovation, I continuously seek to push the boundaries of interactive media while fostering collaboration between disciplines.
